There are two separate README.md files separate from this one.

- One is in backend folder, one is in the frontend folder, you can follow those instructions to run the backend and frontend respectively.

- Backend uses Python with FastAPI and Poetry, and Frontend uses React with Next.js and Shadcn-ui.

- We have two keys to be stored in a .env file in the backend, one is the api key for the hotel/flights api, and the other is the api key for openai chatbot.

- This will be sent to you separately, as it is not included in the repository.
